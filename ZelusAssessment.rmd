0. I would rate my knowledge of cricket as a 2. I knew of the sport and the goal to knock down wickets and score runs by running back and forth. I also knew of the Test and T20 distinctions but did not know the difference between the two, but not much else. I could not name any teams or players. Did not know of any positions outside of the batsment or bowler. I did once accidentally knock a friends tooth out with a cricket bat when I was 10 (but that's a story for another time.)

## Question 1. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
